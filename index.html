            <article>
                <p>From the late 90's I've always had an affinity with computers, be it 
                    programming or playing Civilization III. I created this site to lead 
                    me to obtain my goal of working in the tech field.
                </p>
                <p>I am a driven individual, if I set myself a goal I do my utmost to 
                    complete it, with this in mind, I have been furthering my programming 
                    knowledge to become a good all-around programmer.
                </p>
                <p>Currently, I'm studying front-end development and doing projects to 
                    improve my coding. I have taken a number of courses offered by Udacity, 
                    freecodeCamp and Codecademy. I've implemented what I have learned in 
                    the projects on this site.

                <div class="project" id="project_one" hidden>
                        <p>One of the main Projects for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree, the objective for this 
                                project was to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript alongside changing the HTML CSS coding to style the project. 
                                I was provided with the basic game layout and some JavaScript coding. 
                            </p>
                </div>

                <div class="project" id="project_two" hidden>
                        <p>The main objective of this project was to learn test-driven development. This involves learning to write 
                                tests first before starting to write the code. I was provided with a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and 
                                had to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against the pre-existing application.
                            </p>
                </div>
